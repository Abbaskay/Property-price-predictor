# Property Price Predictor 🏠

A machine learning project that predicts property prices using a real-world Delhi housing dataset. This project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression techniques to estimate market values and analyze pricing trends.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow from data exploration to model evaluation. By analyzing housing data from Delhi, the model learns patterns in property pricing and can predict prices for new properties based on their characteristics.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering and analysis
- Regression modeling techniques
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Real-world application to Delhi housing market

## 🎯 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from raw data
- **Multiple Regression Models**: Testing and comparing different algorithms
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing pricing trends and relationships
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics and cross-validation
- **Price Prediction**: Predict property prices based on input features

## 📋 Dataset

The project uses a real-world Delhi housing dataset containing property information such as:
- Property location
- Square footage/area
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Age of property
- Price (target variable)

*Note: Ensure you have the dataset file in your local environment before running the notebook.*
